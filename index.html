                            experience shortness of breath. Intense coughing fits have even caused patients to cough

                            making them feel out of breath even at rest.

                            <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have
                                been in a
                                public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
                            <li>If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60%
                                alcohol.
                                Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
                            <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                            <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick</li>
                            <li>Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community.

                            <li>If you are sick: You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing
                                a room or
                                vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare providerâ€™s office. If you are not able to wear a
                                facemask (for
                                example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your
                                coughs and
                                sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room.
                            </li>
